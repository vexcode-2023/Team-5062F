### python
I made this program in python with the vscode extension. I’m not sure if it would make for the best example as I didn’t program it particularly efficiently, and some other issues that caused me to restart my program for worlds

### worlds
Here’s my cpp worlds program that also didn’t work particularly well (also with the VEX vscode extension (not PROS)), but it is significantly larger and a lot of parts are a lot harder to read (it was my first time programming in c plus plus). (also it didn’t help that it hardly worked and none of our autons worked at worlds except a one ball
